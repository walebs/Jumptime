# Background

A group of me and 4 other individuals who wanted to make a fun and creative android application about skydivers finding stations to do safe jumps in Norway. The group could make the application work with APIs that gathered weather information from places in Norway and make rough estimates. 

# Execution

We ran the code using emulators in Android Studio, especially the Google Pixel models.

# After thought

After weeks of developing the application, we wish we had more time to add side features.
